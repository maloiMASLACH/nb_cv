          <p>
            Like many guys, programming was interesting to me as a child,
            probably because of games. Now I am a graduate of the Faculty of
            Information Technology, but I still have not been able to connect my
            life with programming. But now, unlike childhood, I understand what
            kind of work I have to do and I think I'm ready for that. I took the
            RSS-Scholl courses and received a certificate of completion of the
            second stage, but due to military training I could not continue my
            studies. Having returned and thought everything over, I am ready to
            spend all my time to achieve a result. Based on the results of the
            English test at the EPAM, the level of English is B1 +, if it
            matters.

            Most of my projects look pretty soggy. were made during training for
            the implementation of the TK. I had experience of working both with
            pure JS and with c TS.There were also projects that included working
            with the server, but I cannot demonstrate them since the school's
            server is no longer working and i didn`t made copies of them.
